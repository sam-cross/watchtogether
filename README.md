# Usage

Clicking "New Room" will create a room with a unique URL - this URL can be sent to friends to allow them to join your room.

## Room Menu

When inside the room menu, you can set a password on all links, or create a new link with limited uses. The original link will always have **unlimited uses**.

The room menu also allows the owner of the room to set other room managers.

## Layout

On the right is a chat window, and on the left is the YouTube player. Chat can be hidden by clicking the arrow on the right-hand side of the player.

To access the room menu, click the button in the top-left.
